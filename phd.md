#### Abstract:

In this thesis we deal with the operational behaviours of two quantitative
extensions of pure &#x3BB;-calculus, namely the *algebraic
&#x3BB;-calculus* and the *probabilistic &#x3BB;-calculus*.

In the first part, we study the &beta;-reduction theory of the algebraic
&#x3BB;-calculus, a calculus allowing formal finite linear combinations of
&#x3BB;-terms to be expressed. Although the system enjoys the Church-Rosser
property, reduction collapses in presence of negative coefficients. We
exhibit a solution to the consequent loss of the notion of (unique) normal
form, allowing the definition of a partial, but consistent, term
equivalence. We then introduce a variant of &beta;-reduction defined on
canonical terms only, which we show partially characterises the previously
established notion of normal form. In the process, we prove a factorisation
theorem.

In the second part, we study bisimulation and context equivalence in a
&#x3BB;-calculus endowed with a probabilistic choice. We show a technique
for proving congruence of probabilistic applicative bisimilarity. While the
technique follows Howe's method, some of the technicalities are quite
different, relying on non-trivial "disentangling" properties for sets of
real numbers. Finally we show that, while bisimilarity is in general
strictly finer than context equivalence, coincidence between the two
relations is achieved on pure &#x3BB;-terms. The resulting equality is that
induced by Lévy-Longo trees, generally accepted as the finest extensional
equivalence on pure &#x3BB;-terms under a lazy regime.
