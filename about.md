Hey there!

Since December 2019, I am a research engineer at the
[CEA-List](http://www-list.cea.fr/en/), in the Software Safety and Security Lab.,
mostly working on [Frama-C](https://www.frama-c.com/).

Previously, I have been an engineer at TrustInSoft for two years with a focus on
developing static analysis tools.

Even earlier, I have been a postdoc at the
[CEA-List](http://www-list.cea.fr/en/), in the Software Safety and Security
Lab., under the supervision of [Julien
Signoles](http://julien.signoles.free.fr/).

In late 2014, I got a PhD in Mathematics from [Aix-Marseille
Université](http://www.univ-amu.fr/) and in Computer Science from [Università di
Bologna](http://www.unibo.it/). I worked on esoteric algebraic (in the sense of
vector spaces) extensions of the [pure
&#x3BB;-calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). In case you
enjoy reading mathematical nonsense, my dissertation is [here]({{ site.baseurl
}}{{ site.phd }}).

I support the work done by [Grusol](http://grusol.it/) (in Italian).

See ya!
